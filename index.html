  Viridianville, <i>(also referred to as "Project Viridian")</i> is a rewrite of <i>Legend of the Green Dragon</i> a browser-game where you find yourself in a new village, with dangerous forests beyond it.
  Adventure out, but be careful not to become ensnared by the wild things that hide in the shadows. This rewrite is being done in support of a specific gaming community.
