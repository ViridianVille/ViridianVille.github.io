## What?

At Project Viridian, we're rewriting *Legend of the Green Dragon*.

> Legend of the Green Dragon is a text-based RPG originally developed by Eric Stevens and JT Traub as a remake of and homage to the classic BBS Door game, Legend of the Red Dragon, by Seth Able Robinson.

Legend of the Green Dragon was originally made and released in 2005, and the internet has changed **a lot** since then. We're accessing content more often from our mobiles than our computers, we're using integrations with apps such as Discord, and we are driven by notifications and quick responses.

Our rewrite aims to bring Legend of the Green Dragon into the Internet as we use it today, rewriting *Ye Old Messages* to flow more naturally, encouraging responses to conversation, alerting people when the area of the game they are in has updated, improving support for alt-characters, modernising gender and relationship options, improving accessibility to meet modern standards, and much more. 

## Why?

We're doing this, because us and our friends love playing the game, but the original gamecode is now so old, it's very difficult to update it for modern use without breaking a lot of stuff at the same time! We're not intending to make money off our work - in fact <span xmlns:dct="http://purl.org/dc/terms/" href="http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/InteractiveResource" property="dct:title" rel="dct:type">Project Viridian</span> is licensed under a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</a>. So that anyone can use our code, and improve it, as long as they;

* Give us attribution for our code,
* Don't use it for Commercial uses,
* And share their code in a similar fashion.

## When?

Well, we don't know exactly when our project will be ready for release, we're working hard to make it right, but this takes time. Our goal is to release somepoint during 2023, but we don't want to affix a certain date to it just yet.
