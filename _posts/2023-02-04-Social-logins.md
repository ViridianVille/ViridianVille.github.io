We had hoped to add Social Logins to the game within Project Viridian. This feature would have let you truely link your Viridian account to your accounts for other social networks. Unfortunately, given developments in the industry recently, we are no longer able to do this to the standard we would like to. It is our intention that this feature will be available in some form, however it is likely that it won't support a number of the social networks that we had hoped to support.

## Services we currently hope to support;

* F-List
* FurAffinity
* Mastodon
* Spoutible
* *Others*

## Services we are unlikely to support;

* Twitter
* Meta-owned services; Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, etc.
* Truth Social
* Gab
* Other services where linking would violate either their terms of service, or our own terms of service.
